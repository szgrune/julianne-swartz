While residential and utility scale solar have exploded with access to institutional investment, commercial scale rooftops have generally lagged due to these challenges and the broad range of building types and uses.`,

                      `Once an open-pit mine where rich clay deposits were extracted until the late 1800s, when depleted, “Jerry’s Pit” filled with water and became a popular swimming hole for the neighboring working-class community for almost 100 years. However in 1961 it was fenced-off and public access has been denied for 60 years while large portions of the adjacent land were polluted by the infamous W.R. Grace chemical company.`,
                      `Today, there are nearly 4,000 affordable housing residents living across the street so restoring the site for safe public access while enhancing the natural ecosystem provides a generational opportunity for a new reservation and pond within a significant environmental justice community. While fences have protected the community from asbestos left in the soil by W.R Grace, they have left a permanent blight in a neighborhood now settled by an extremely diverse population, many of whom do not have easy access to natural areas further afield.`,
                      `Over the last half-century, wildlife has flourished around the pond and surrounding land and a sensitive, well-considered re-opening of the site via boardwalks and with the addition of an expanded wetland, off-road bike-way and nature paths, could create an unusual opportunity for enhancing habitat and reconnecting the urban community with nature. As a cofounder of the friends group, I have led on a pro bono basis, the creation of a conceptual plan with support from donated landscape design visualizations. Our concept for the site has now gained the attention of city government, including the Mayor, as well as important environmental NGOs.`,
                      `The broader geography of what is now called “Jerry’s Pond” was once referred to as “The Great Swamp” – a place rich in wetlands and bird-life which supported a fishery that lent its name to an area known today as Alewife. With the growing impacts of climate change – heat island, air pollution, sea level rise and storm surge risk – the pond area can play an important role. Providing space for the planting of many trees and expanding a diverse wetland while maintaining flood water storage could help alleviate these problems while making the community feel welcome as well.`,
                      `In addition to its siting as the “backyard” for thousands of affordable housing residents, Jerry’s Pond and its environs are steps away from the Red Line, Boston’s main subway branch and adjacent to one of the nation’s most popular rails-to-trails. Thousands of commuters pass by via subway, bicycle and on the busy roads heading through or to the large new commercial buildings and thousands of apartments built in adjacent formerly industrial lands. There are increasingly rare opportunities to create new open space and natural areas and it is an absolutely unique opportunity to find an “extra pond”, even one as neglected as this, in the middle of the city, where even a great blue heron rookery has found a home for four summers running.`,

Concrete, chain link fencing and no-trespassing signs across the street from approximately 4,000 affordable housing residents in the three Rindge Towers, Jefferson Park and other affordable housing properties along Rindge Ave. A former mine pit which awaits transformation and re-naturalization.`,

Additional capping with clean soil to create a restored, re-naturalized and accessible linear park providing a more diverse wetland ecosystem with a curving, gradual pond bank, additional space for tree planting to mitigate heat-island impacts, improve air quality and add habitat, a meandering walking path to reconnect residents with nature, seating for observation of the annual heron rookery and other species around the pond, a sidewalk now separated from traffic, a two-way off-road bike path and swales for rainfall absorption into the water table.<br><small>3D visualization created by Anna Curtis-Heald [Drag arrow to scroll] for Friends of Jerry’s Pond</small>`
